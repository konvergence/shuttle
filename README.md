### What's new

#### General
        SAML :
            Multi-Provider Support SAML Multiple Identity Providers (IdP) are supported. Users are prompted to make their choice before authenticating.
        Server Performance : 
            The performance of operations (creating, updating, and deleting values) on cell texts and comments has been improved.
            The performance of the Clean Texts and Comments task has been highly optimized. Based on the usage frequency of texts or comments, it is recommended to run this task on a weekly or daily schedule.
            Various performance improvements have been made on cubes with large amounts of data or text: processing, transaction and caching have been optimized for large volumes of data or text.

        Auditing :
            User auditing on successful logging now explicitly lists all repositories the user can access along with the corresponding authentication source. This allows tracking precisely who has access to what on a session basis.

#### Shuttle Studio
            Improved performance of datamart and repository operations.
            The performance of clear and delete operations has been improved. The operations are highly optimized to handle large volumes of data and text.

#### Shuttle Client
        Improved management of authentication credentials (outside of Shuttle credentials).
        Users are always prompted to enter Proxy authentication credentials which are persistent as part of connection parameters if the 'Use proxy credentials' option is set.
        Users are always prompted to enter Server authentication credentials which are stored in cache if user selects the Remember me option.
        Users can use the Clear Cache option to flush cached credentials.
        Improved sharing of connections, applications, and tabs In addition to sharing
        links to tabs via the clipboard or email, users can now share links to applications.
        Users can now also share connections to Shuttle servers via the clipboard or email. This can be used to distribute new connections to users.
        New connections are automatically added to the list of connections or updated. Clearing the cache doesn't clear the connection.
       Improved caching of images on cells with value types with images
